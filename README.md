## Repository Overview

Welcome to the repository! This repository contains two main components:

1. **Case Study: Student Performance**
2. **Solved Python Problems**

### 1. Case Study: Student Performance

This section of the repository includes a detailed analysis of student performance data. The case study aims to uncover patterns and insights that can help in understanding the factors affecting student performance. 

#### Contents:
- **Dataset**: The raw data used for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Scripts and notebooks used for data preprocessing.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and descriptive statistics.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of various machine learning models to predict student performance.
- **Results**: Findings and insights derived from the analysis.

#### How to Run:
1. Navigate to the `student-performance` directory.
2. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in sequence for a step-by-step walkthrough of the analysis.

### 2. Solved Python Problems

This section includes a collection of Python problems that have been solved as part of coursework and personal practice. The problems range from beginner to advanced levels and cover various topics such as algorithms, data structures, and data manipulation.

#### Contents:
- **Problem Statements**: A brief description of each problem.
- **Solutions**: Python scripts and notebooks containing the solved problems.
- **Explanations**: Detailed explanations and comments within the code to help understand the approach and logic.

#### How to Run:
1. Navigate to the `python-problems` directory.
2. Open the respective Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to review the problem statements and solutions.
